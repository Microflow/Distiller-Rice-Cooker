##### *Really is a great hobby  just do what were sayin and you'll cut your first tooth safely...*

## Parts List

- Copper Cooling coil
- Drill a hole in the rice cooker lid?
- Condenser

### NOTE: Bigger Cookers make things easier: "Do your reading and I do think your gonna need a bigger cooker. I would go at least 12L. It just makes things much easier for you."

### A little rough for water distillation, but shows the principles well. 

A still has two parts, a boiler and a condenser.

A rice cooker/warmer makes a great boiler.
It's got a rubber gasket so all the steam goes out the vent. It's insulated so all the heat goes into the mash.

A plastic garbage bag makes a great condenser.
It's got lots of surface area, cooling and condensing the vapor very quickly.
In my experiments it didn't need to be vented and hardly puffed up at all.

I tested my still by distilling a gallon of "rice wine for cooking" which has salt added to it to keep people from using it as a beverage. I put the bag in a tub to keep it from rolling off the table when it got heavy, and in case the bag leaked.

The whole system works great!
